# Concurrency Challenge

## Setup

Download the [plutus
repository](https://www.github.com/input-output-hk/plutus) and follow
its setup instructions. Nota bene: if you want to avoid compiling GHC
(WHICH YOU DO), please do not forget to set up the IOHK binary
cache. Once set up, open a nix shell with the command `nix-shell`.

## Notes to Self

1. [Here](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) is a useful guide on starting up cabal.
